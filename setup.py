"""
The code you provided is a Python script that sets up a package using setuptools. Let's go through the code and explain each part:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup: This line imports the necessary functions from the setuptools module. find_packages is used to locate all packages and modules in the current directory, while setup is a function used to configure the package.

HYPEN_E_DOT = '-e .': This line defines a constant variable HYPEN_E_DOT and assigns it the value "-e .".

def get_requirements(file_path:str)->List[str]:: This line defines a function named get_requirements that takes a file path as an argument and returns a list of strings.

requirements=[]: This line initializes an empty list called requirements.

with open(file_path) as file_obj:: This line opens the file specified by file_path in a context manager, allowing us to read its contents.

requirements=file_obj.readlines(): This line reads all the lines from the file and assigns them to the requirements variable as a list.

requirements = [req.replace('\n','') for req in requirements]: This line uses a list comprehension to remove the newline character ('\n') from each line in the requirements list.

if HYPEN_E_DOT in requirements: requirements.remove(HYPEN_E_DOT): This conditional statement checks if the HYPEN_E_DOT string is present in the requirements list. If it is, it removes it from the list.

return requirements: This line returns the requirements list.

setup(...): This line sets up the package configuration using the setup function from setuptools. Here are the arguments passed to the function:
